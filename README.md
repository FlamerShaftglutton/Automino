# Automino
Roguelite automation/factory game made in Processing. Heavily inspired by Plate Up.

Horrible programmer art and no sound, but gameplay that I enjoy.

Extensible rougelite game that can be easily rethemed. Difficulty keeps ramping until you lose. Every 4 levels you get a Curse, which changes the rules in some negative way. Every 10 levels you get a Boon, which changes the rules favorably.

You need to balance finishing early to get more machinery versus pushing your luck to upgrade your existing machines versus finishing on time to stay in the game.

Once you lose you can create a new game using your choice of Curses and Boons you've had in previous games. This allows you to start your next run in better position than before.

Move around with the arrow keys, activate things with the X key, pause with P, and occassionally push Y to close a screen. Has a tutorial to explain how to play as well.
